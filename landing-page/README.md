## 🚀 Running Locally

Since this is a static site, you can view it directly in your browser:

1.  Navigate to this folder in your file explorer.
2.  Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.

Alternatively, for a better development experience (e.g., to handle absolute paths or hot reloading), use a local server:

```bash
# Using Python (built-in)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using VS Code Live Server extension
# Right-click index.html -> "Open with Live Server"
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` (or the port provided by your tool).
